# Sora-substrate Ethereum bridge Smart contract Java Wrapper

In order to run this demo, three pieces of information are required:

1. Ethereum client (or node) endpoint. The simplest thing to do is 
[request a free access token](https://infura.io/register) from Infura.
1. A wallet file. This can be generated using the [Epirus CLI](https://docs.epirus.io/sdk/cli/). 
1. Some Ether. This can be requested from the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet).

Once these details have been added to the main Application class, you'll be good to go.
